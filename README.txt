Documentation for SAP ABAP Report: Modify MARA Table Records
Overview
This ABAP report is designed to facilitate the modification of records in the MARA table. It leverages the ALV (ABAP List Viewer) for display and interactive modification of data, providing both display and change functionalities. Users can insert new rows, delete existing rows, and modify data directly in the ALV grid.

Structure
The report consists of several key sections and functionalities:

Global Data Definitions
Class Definitions and Implementations
Selection Screen
Event Handlers
Main Processing Logic
ALV Display and Interaction
Helper Forms
Global Data Definitions
The report starts with defining global constants and data structures necessary for ALV display and data manipulation.

Constants
gc_cust_cont_name: Name of the custom container on the screen.
gc_display: Constant for display mode.
gc_change: Constant for change mode.
Data Structures
ty_outtab: Structure for output table including MARA and cell styles.
tbl_outtab: Table type for ty_outtab.
tbl_mara: Table type for MARA.
Global Variables
gt_tblmara, gt_mara, gs_mara: Tables and structures for MARA data.
gr_alvgrid, gr_evt_rec, gr_ccontainer: References for ALV grid, event handler, and custom container.
gt_fieldcat: Field catalog for ALV.
gf_dispchg, gf_err_flag, gf_dplctv_flag: Flags for display/change mode and error handling.
Class Definitions and Implementations
The class lcl_evt_rec handles ALV toolbar and user command events. It includes methods:

handle_toolbar: Adds custom buttons to the ALV toolbar.
handle_user_command: Processes user commands from the ALV toolbar.
data_changed: Handles data change events in the ALV grid.
Selection Screen
The selection screen allows users to filter data by material number (MARA-MATNR).

Event Handlers
Event handlers are defined for the selection screen and ALV interactions:

AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON VALUE-REQUEST FOR s_matnr-low: Provides F4 help for material number.
START-OF-SELECTION: Checks user authorization and fetches data for display.
END-OF-SELECTION: Prepares and displays the ALV grid on screen 0100.
Main Processing Logic
Main processing logic includes:

F4 Help: Function module F4IF_INT_TABLE_VALUE_REQUEST is used for F4 help on material number.
Data Retrieval: get_mara_data fetches data from MARA based on selection criteria.
Status and User Command Handling: Handles status and user commands for the ALV grid.
ALV Display and Interaction
The ALV grid is set up and managed through several forms:

display_alv: Sets up the ALV grid for the first display and handles refreshing.
prepare_field_catalog: Prepares the field catalog for ALV display.
remove_tb_buttons: Removes unwanted toolbar buttons from the ALV grid.
Helper Forms
Several helper forms assist in the functionality:

handle_toolbar: Adds custom buttons to the ALV toolbar.
save_data: Saves modified data back to the MARA table.
add_row: Adds a new row to the ALV grid.
delete_row: Deletes a selected row from the ALV grid.
